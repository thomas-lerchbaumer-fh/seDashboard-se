Team: Dominic, Thomas, Thomas 


# Please do not...
...push changes you do not understand and could cause harm (especially if you installed a plugin or made changes to the package.json)

# Please do...
...create your own branches when starting to work on the project

# Install instructions
be sure to be in the root folder and you've got node installed 

now (in the terminal) type:

npm i  
cd frontend  
npm i  
cd ..  
npm run dev  


Note! npm run dev will start both the backend server and the frontend 
you are basically done now.

# Note!
@config defaul.json is missing (it carries db login infos)

Happy coding
